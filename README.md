Shehack-20

FarmHub is an open-source platform where the request to sell and
buy of given farm production as in form of push and pull request, it would having the following facilities as
listed down:


1. farmers can get predicted the market value of the crop that year and also can register through software
or by sending a text message to a specific number before they invest and strat particular crop
cultivation.it called predicted push request.

2. different small industries and other organisation can set up their requirement by only posting the
request as we do in any open-source platform, it will be called an initial pull request.

3. After the harvesting of crops, the farmer can push their actual request and get some suggestion
which uses some used algorithm to which market they can pull their crop along with an accurate
prediction of suitable place where market price +transpotation cost will maximize the profit. here I
would also like to mention that software analyses other predicted push to request that if they push their
crop with x,y,z farmer of his locality, the transportation cost can be minimised.

4. we can also add some farm production bidding techniques to maximize the profit and also minimize
the market cost of that farm product. as if it was done by some middleman or organisation their cost
also includes in actual product cost.in that way, the final pull request is more optimised and beneficial
for supplier and production org i.e. our farmers.

5. we can also extend it to dairy and other agriculture product so Farming/agriculture can become
business as was in a few centuries ago.
